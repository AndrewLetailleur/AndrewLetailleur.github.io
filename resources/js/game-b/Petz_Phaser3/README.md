# Petz_Phaser3

Petz is a Virtual Interactive Pet game, with growth and training mechanics created within Phaser 3

Inspired from previous virtual pet games like Nintendo Dogs and Tamagotchi, this game is to make a simplistic version
using simple minigames to grow your pets gradually the more you play.

Please note that this is the first project we've all created with ES6 so some of the programming
may be a little all over the place due to module understanding.
